/**
 * Integration Tests - Placeholder
 *
 * Integration tests will be added as the application is developed.
 * These tests will verify that multiple components work together correctly.
 *
 * Examples of future integration tests:
 * - API route handlers with validation and caching
 * - Redis cache integration with API providers
 * - Rate limiting middleware with API routes
 * - Error handling across multiple layers
 * - Authentication flow (when implemented)
 *
 * Target: 20% of total test coverage (per TESTING_STRATEGY.md)
